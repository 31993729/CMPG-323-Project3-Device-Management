## Project 3

## Error's while creating and forking the repo's
Tried to add it to my already created Project 3 in my overview Repo, but was unsucceful, because it does not work if you have two repos in one so had to start from scratch 3 days later
when I saw that it was not gonna work, but my original repository that is in the overview Repo if you want to check:
https://github.com/31993729/CMPG323-Overview-31993729/tree/main/Project%203

## What i did after starting over 
Forked the Repository of JacquiM
Created dbcontext Scaffolding
Changed the connection string
Added GenericRepositories, IGenericRepositoriesa, CategoryRepositories, ICategoryRepositories, DeviceRepositories, IDeviceRepositories, ZoneRepositories, IZoneRepositories
Changed the Controllers to use GenericRepositories and IGenericRepositories
